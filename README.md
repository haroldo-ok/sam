SAM - Simple Adventure Maker
===

This is a tool for creating simple adventure games for the Sega Master System. Pretty barebones, pretty much unfinished, but it should be enough for making some simple games.

Updated SAM_Interpreter.asm:
- Changed menu display routine to avoid the hidden "downwards" issue.
- Added preliminary code for sound effect when pressing down or up.
